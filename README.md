# Semi-Ragdoll
Creating a Semi-Ragdoll puppet character in Unity

In this project I mainly wanted to recreate Peter Javidpour's character that he had made in Unreal Engine. I knew the character was a ragdoll and after many trial and errors. I landed on a technique of using ragdolls for just limbs. The ragdoll isn't created using Unity's default ragdoll creator but built on configurable joints.
